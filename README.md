## Slack Events API adapter for Node

Build your Slack apps by reacting to messages, emojis, files, and many more types of interesting
events in the [Events API](https://api.slack.com/events-api). This package will help you start
with sensible and secure defaults.

The adapter gives you a simple and highly configurable Node-style [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter) to attach functions
to handle events.
